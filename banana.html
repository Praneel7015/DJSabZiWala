    <h1>Banana Fruit History</h1>

    <p>Bananas, scientifically known as Musa, belong to the family Musaceae. These delightful and nutritious fruits have a rich history originating from Southeast Asia.</p>

    <p>The introduction of bananas to the world is credited to Portuguese sailors who first brought them to the Americas. Since then, bananas have become a staple fruit enjoyed by people worldwide.</p>
