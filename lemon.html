    <h1>Lemon Fruit History</h1>

    <p>Lemons, scientifically known as Citrus × limon, belong to the Rutaceae family. These fruits have a long and diverse history.</p>

    <p>Lemons are native to Asia, primarily Northeast India, Northern Myanmar, and China. The tree's ellipsoidal yellow fruit is used for culinary and non-culinary purposes throughout the world, primarily for its juice, which has both culinary and cleaning uses. The pulp and rind are also used in cooking and baking.</p>

    <p>Known for their versatility, lemons are consumed fresh, used in cooking, and processed into various products. They also hold cultural significance in many traditions and stories.</p>

    <p>Lemons are grown in a variety of climates but thrive in temperate regions with distinct seasons. The cultivation of different lemon varieties has led to a wide range of flavors, colors, and textures.</p>
