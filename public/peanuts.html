    <h1>Peanut Nut History</h1>

    <p>Peanuts (Arachis hypogaea) are a type of legume, but are often included in the nut category because of their similar taste and nutritional profile. They're native to South America and are high in protein, fiber, and various essential nutrients. They're usually sold shelled and raw or roasted.</p>

    <p>Known for their rich flavor and crunchy texture, peanuts are consumed in a variety of ways, including raw, roasted, or as a key ingredient in many dishes like peanut butter and gado-gado. They also hold cultural significance in many traditions and stories.</p>

    <p>Peanut plants are grown in a variety of climates but thrive in tropical and subtropical regions. The cultivation of different peanut varieties has led to a wide range of flavors, colors, and sizes.</p>
