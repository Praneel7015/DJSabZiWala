    <h1>Almond Nut History</h1>

    <p>Almonds (Prunus dulcis) are the edible seeds of the almond tree, native to Iran and surrounding countries but widely cultivated elsewhere. Almonds are sold shelled (i.e., after the shells are removed), or unshelled (i.e., with the shells still attached).</p>

    <p>Known for their versatility and high nutritional value, almonds are consumed in a variety of ways, including raw, roasted, or as a key ingredient in many dishes. They also hold cultural significance in many traditions and stories.</p>

    <p>Almond trees are grown in a variety of climates but thrive in Mediterranean climates. The cultivation of different almond varieties has led to a wide range of flavors, colors, and sizes.</p>
